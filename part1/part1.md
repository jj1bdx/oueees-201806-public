# Before starting the today's talk: the risk of being a professional and exposure to the public

* You might be harassed, harmed, and attacked at any time
* The attackers are *anonymous* while you are *well-identified*
* *Anyone can be a target*
* Stay low profile when you can
* Stay vigilant

# Today's topic: communication fundamentals of the packet switching networks

---

# Communication: sharing a medium

* Sharing a physical link between two or multiple parties
* *The physical layer*
* A medium could be: electric wires, optic fibers, radio airwaves, sound, flying birds like pigeons

# Connecting unconnected nodes

There are many ways to connect the dots in this picture

---

# Simplest way: star/centralized connection

- Centralized connection was the easiest way to connect the nodes
- Very much susceptible to network link failures
- Links should stay connected during the connection
